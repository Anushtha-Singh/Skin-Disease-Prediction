              This project is aimed at predicting various skin diseases using deep learning and image classification.
              Our system allows users to upload an image or use a camera to get quick predictions about potential skin conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early detection of skin issues can lead to better treatment outcomes and potentially save lives.
              While our tool provides valuable insights, it's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis.
